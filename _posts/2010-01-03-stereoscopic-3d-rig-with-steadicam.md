See my [previous post](/2009/12/stereoscopic-3d-video-rig.html) on a different 3D rig design, and a discussion of how to postprocess the videos in QuickTime Pro. I decided to build a Steadicam to help reduce jerkiness when recording while walking. I used the design from [steadycam.org](http://steadycam.org/). This steadicam works with any camera with a tripod mount. So to mount two stereoscopic cameras, I found an 8" doorjamb striker plate that had two holes 6.5cm apart and a third hole for mounting on the steadicam.

I covered this with a thin layer of foam rubber, then attached the two cameras with 1/4" X 20 bolts, and attached the plate to the steadicam using a washer and toggle bolt. The cameras need to be slightly rotated to stay coplanar - because the screw holes in the plate are staggered.

So the cameras mounted on the steadicam look like this:

Here is a [sample video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBuhKp6nlJg) shot with this rig.
