Spam subjects I have enjoyed:

> Subject: wiener wiener chicken digger
> Subject: Surprise her with the nicest bag in town
> Subject: experience queen-sized dick
> She likes her kitty stretched and do you have the capability to do it?

Some fake spam headlines are good too:

> Subject: Clinton found hanged in bedroom
> Subject: Afghan bombing kills President Bush
> Subject: Angelina Jolie dies in miscarriage
> Subject: Michael Jackson gives up being pedophile
