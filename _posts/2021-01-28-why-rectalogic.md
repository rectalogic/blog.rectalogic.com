Years ago I found a company called [analogic](https://www.analogic.com/).

I thought it was brave that they put *anal* front and center in their name.
Even their logo kind of looks like a techno-stylized puckered hole

So I figured if an international corporation can choose this name,
I can do something similar.

Other words that make me laugh:

*analyze*, *therapist*, *banal*, the [ASS](https://file.org/extension/ass) file format


I turn 12 in February.
